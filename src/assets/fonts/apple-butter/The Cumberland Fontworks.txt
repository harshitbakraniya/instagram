This font is the work of S. John Ross, a one-mand band punching out warm hand-drawn fonts, funky stress-fonts, and oddball fonts like HexPaper and Sparks for more than a decade, now. For more fonts like this (and decidedly unlike this), search for my name in relation to fonts, or come directly to the Fontworks for a gallery of some of my favorite releases.
